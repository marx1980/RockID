# State

Current phase: **P1 Candidate harvesting** (see docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

## Built
- Phase 0 scaffold: isolated Challenge Vault, manifest validator, leakage checks, metrics, blind harness, quality gate, k-NN aggregation, DB schemas, CI
- P1: Smithsonian + Commons connectors, licence policy, idempotent harvest CLI, promote CLI (download, fingerprint, validate), `harvest-candidates` Actions workflow

## Stubbed / not run
- DINOv2 / SigLIP2 adapters (no weights downloaded)
- Postgres-backed ReferenceIndex and ChallengeStore
- Evaluator service in compose

## Known gaps
- Smithsonian query syntax (`unit_code:` / `online_media_type:` filters) and Commons search quality are verified only against hand-written fixtures until the first live run
- Commons specimen hints are filename heuristics
- No review UI yet: review_decision is edited in the CSV

## Next
Run `harvest-candidates`, check gate G-02, get H-01 sign-off, then P2.
